This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises from the book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://transformersbook.com)
implemented in Python. The notebooks are organized by chapter, and each notebook corresponds to a chapter or section in the book.
Each notebook contains code snippets, data, and visualizations from the corresponding chapter in the book.
The official notebooks are in [notebooks](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks) repository. 
I mainly followed the codes from the chapters. There is no notebook for Chapter 1, since it contains only descriptions. 

Note that the notebooks in this repository are based on my personal interpretation of the book, and may not reflect the author's intended meaning. 

## About book

NLP with Transformers  is a straightforward book that provides an overview of the transformers 
and how to implement them using the HuggingFace library. 
The book's chapters are structured around various NLP tasks, with each chapter covering the essential components 
needed to build a model for that task. 
The book is written in a high-level style, without delving into deep technical explanations. 
Therefore, if you're looking to use the HuggingFace library to run models without having a mathematical background, this is a perfect book for you. 
However, if you're seeking an in-depth understanding of the mathematical formulation of transformers and want to explore them further, 
you might not find this book to be comprehensive enough for your needs.

For me, this book was a first step to understand several concepts: dataloader, pipelines and datasets. 
It is a more practical book than a theoretical one, which made it easier for me to grasp the main concepts and apply them to my own projects.
The book provides clear and concise explanations of the HuggingFace library's functionalities, 
and the code examples are easy to follow.
